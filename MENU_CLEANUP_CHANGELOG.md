# Menu Cleanup - Usulan Cuti System

## Changes Made

### âœ… Removed Menus
1. **"Usulan Cuti"** (`/leave-proposals`) - Removed from sidebar
2. **"Daftar Usulan"** (`/proposal-list`) - Removed from sidebar

### âœ… Kept Menus
1. **"Pengajuan Cuti"** (`/leave-requests`) - For individual leave request input

- Riwayat Cuti (filtered by unit)
- Surat Keterangan
- Pengaturan

#### For Master Admin:
- Data Pegawai (all units)
- Pengajuan Cuti (all units)
- **Usulan per Unit** (view/manage by unit, generate batch letters)
- Riwayat Cuti (all units)
- Surat Keterangan
- User Management
- Pengaturan

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **src/components/Sidebar.jsx**
   - Removed "Usulan Cuti" and "Daftar Usulan" menu items
   - Removed permission checks for deleted menus
   - Cleaned up unused icon imports (Send, List)

2. **src/App.jsx**
   - Removed routes for `/leave-proposals` and `/proposal-list`
   - Removed imports for LeaveProposals and ProposalList components

3. **src/pages/UserManagement.jsx**
   - Removed `leave_proposals_unit` permission from admin_unit role
   - Updated permission description for admin_unit

### Files Kept (but no longer accessible via menu):
- `src/pages/LeaveProposals.jsx` - Component still exists but no route
- `src/pages/ProposalList.jsx` - Component still exists but no route
- `src/hooks/useLeaveProposals.js` - Hook still exists
- `src/utils/leaveProposalLetterGenerator.js` - Still used by BatchLeaveProposals

## Workflow After Cleanup

### Admin Unit Workflow:
1. Login â†’ See only own unit's data
2. Use **"Pengajuan Cuti"** to create individual leave requests
3. All requests automatically appear in master admin's **"Usulan per Unit"**

### Master Admin Workflow:
1. Login â†’ See all units' data
2. Use **"Usulan per Unit"** to view leave requests grouped by unit
3. Generate batch letters for entire units at once
4. Use **"Pengajuan Cuti"** for manual individual requests if needed

## Benefits of Cleanup

### âœ… Simplified Navigation
- Reduced menu clutter
- Clear purpose for each menu
- No overlapping functionality

### âœ… Clearer Workflow
- One path for leave request input ("Pengajuan Cuti")
- One path for batch management ("Usulan per Unit")
- No confusion about which menu to use

### âœ… Better User Experience
- Admin units: Simple workflow - just create requests
- Master admin: Powerful batch management tool
- Consistent data source (all from leave_requests table)

### âœ… Maintained Functionality
- All leave request data still accessible
- Batch letter generation still works
- Unit-based filtering still functional
- Role-based access still enforced

## Data Flow

```
Admin Unit creates leave request
          â†“
    (leave_requests table)
          â†“
Master Admin sees in "Usulan per Unit"
          â†“
Generate batch letter for unit
```

## Migration Notes
- No database changes required
- No data loss
- Existing leave requests remain accessible
- All functionality preserved, just simplified access

This cleanup makes the system more intuitive while maintaining all the powerful features that were implemented.
